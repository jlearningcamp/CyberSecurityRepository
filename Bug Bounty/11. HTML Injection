- A input field like a search box:
  We enter something -> Check whther it got reflected in our site -> We can check for HTMLi
  Eg: <h1>TEST</h1>
      <h1><u>TEST</u></h1>

- If user agent field like Browser: Firefox, OS: Linux is reflected in the target website -> Intercept it using Burp -> Clear user agent values and input a html tag

- If cookie value is reflected in the target website -> Intercept it using Burp -> Clear cookie values(php session id) and input a html tag

Instead of html header codes, we can use refresh-redirect code also

- Let's say we have a back button on our website, when clicked move to the previous page. It will be having a referrer header if intercepted using burp. We can append our HTML code there. Always try to balance the code like ">/<a> like that...
