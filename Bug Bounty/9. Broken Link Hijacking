- "blc" is a tool to check for broken links on a domain that we input
If 404 error comes up when searched => broken link
Eg: Lets say A is an org.
blc -> a.com -> I found that A.sales.com is giving 404 error => No such page
but A.sales.com may have many links pointed from many other sites 
So I can create A.sales.com page again and can post malicious content
So when users visit the site via links , they see this malicious content

- You can't take over links that are hosted on the target website itself. you can take over those, if subdomain takeover is possible only. otherwise don't take over those links. Check for some other links like LinkedIn, etc etc of the target org
