1) Register in a site - Verify via OTP - Intercept traffic using BurpSuite - Change status value(like success, true etc etc)
2) Can use 0000 as OTP which may be a master OTP
3) If there is no status or response message in burp suite, randomly put a number like 1 and check whether that bypasses
4) In similar way CAPTCHA can also gets bypassed
5) Login successfully with a logged in user like give correct OTP and all. Intercept the request -> Change the userid to someone else's -> Account takeover
6) Enter mobile or email or ID etc etc -> Will ask for OTP -> Intercept this req. -> forward and check at one place we can see the OTP that was sent -> use that OTP to verify/login
ie no need to enter a fake otp and intercept (happened in ICICI Site chat bot) [in these cases intercept the request when clicking on verify via otp like that, don't wait for a fake otp to be entered and intercept that]
7) Similar to OTP/ Captcha, 2FA can also be bypasses even if it is set. Capture the request and check for status that sets 2FA - Update it
8) In some sites, we have option to add another email ID. That too need to be verified. But sometimes if we re-verify the primary email and then come back and refresh, the secondary one will also gets verified without even checking the mail
9) IDOR


Note:
Right click on rqst -> do intercept this response
