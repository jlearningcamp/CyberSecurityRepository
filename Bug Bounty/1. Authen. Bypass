1) Register in a site - Verify via OTP - Intercept traffic using BurpSuite - Change status value(like success, true etc etc)
2) Can use 0000 as OTP which may be a master OTP
3) If there is no status or response message in burp suite, randomly put a number like 1 and check whether that bypasses



Note:
Right click on rqst -> do intercept this response
