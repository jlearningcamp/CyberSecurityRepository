1) Register in a site - Verify via OTP - Intercept traffic using BurpSuite - Change status value(like success, true etc etc)
2) Can use 0000 as OTP which may be a master OTP
3) If there is no status or response message in burp suite, randomly put a number like 1 and check whether that bypasses
4) In similar way CAPTCHA can also gets bypassed
5) Login successfully with a logged in user like give correct OTP and all. Intercept the request -> Change the userid to someone else's -> Account takeover
6) Enter mobile or email or ID etc etc -> Will ask for OTP -> Intercept this req. -> forward and check at one place we can see the OTP that was sent -> use that OTP to verify/login
ie no need to enter a fake otp and intercept (happened in ICICI Site chat bot)

Note:
Right click on rqst -> do intercept this response
