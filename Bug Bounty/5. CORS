Exploitable Test Cases:
- Request: 
  Origin: evil.com (We have to type)
  Response: (below as a response)
  access control allow origin: evil.com / null
  access control allow credentials: true
If we get like above response => CORS


- Domain: abc.com
  In request: Origin: evil.com
  but in response we didn't get the reflection
  The best way to bypass is to:
  Origin: abc.com.evil.com
