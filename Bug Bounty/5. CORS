Exploitable Test Cases:
- Request: 
  Origin: evil.com (We have to type)
  Response: (below as a response)
  access control allow origin: evil.com / null
  access control allow credentials: true
If we get like above response => CORS


- Domain: abc.com
  In request: Origin: evil.com
  but in response we didn't get the reflection
  The best way to bypass is to:
  Origin: abc.com.evil.com
          or
  Origin: evilabc.com


Alternative for Burp is using Curl command:
curl "https://www.abc.com" -I 
where -I means only response headers

To check cors:
curl "https://www.abc.com" -I -H Origin:Specify the origin
where -H is header and origin is as per above test cases
