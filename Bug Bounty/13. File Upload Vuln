- Use tool called Weevely

- If .php is not supported for file upload, try to rename the code file with .jpeg or any other supported extensions. Intercept the upload using Burp. Modify the extension from jpeg to .php in Burp and forward. 
  This will bypass file upload restrictions

- Another option is to modify the file extension as file.jpeg to file.php.jpeg in BurpSuite

- Try for csv injection ie edit csv file name as any cmd like that

- Only png or JPEG allowed -> Upload a png file -> Intercept the req. -> Try to rename as .php and send again -> May work
  If not
        see some encoded or like that content of the file in burp suite. Inject our malicious php payload in between that content
