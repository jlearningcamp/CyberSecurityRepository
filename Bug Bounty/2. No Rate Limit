1) Select a site - Create an account - Intercept the request which intercepts the registration form - Send it to intruder - Mark the emailID or userID as position for sniper attack - Add some valid email IDs as payloads - Mark throttle(Time between two account creation like 5000ms) - uncheck payload encoding - attack.
if we are able to see 200 OK for the attack ie if we are able to create multiple user accounts, then that means the site is vuln to rate limiting

Note: Throttle is available only in Burp Pro. Otherwise use OWASP ZAP

2) Intercept the GET request where we entered OTP. Send to intruder -> mark otp as position -> Put payload sequence to brute force -> Grep match the error code(flag when we see the code)
If we were able to brute force without any block(like many apps may block after 15 attempts), then we can say it is vuln to no rate limit

3) Forgot Password - Enter Mobile to get OTP - Brute force using intruder - No rate limit
