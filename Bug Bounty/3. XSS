- Check for search box
- Enter a random string
- Check whether it got reflected(in the body or URL)
- If reflected, then it is vulnerable to Reflected XSS
- If JS payload does not executes any XSS, try to BALANCE the code

- XSS can be achieved through changing the request method -> Adding an extra header (REFERER)
- XSS can be achieved through storing the payload in cache server ie creating a cache miss
  If data is stored = MISS
  Not Stored        = HIT
- "><svg/onload=confirm(1)>"@x.y on email address field in login page
