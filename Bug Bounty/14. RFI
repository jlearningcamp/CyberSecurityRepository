- Similar to LFI
In LFI we fetch local rsrcs like etc/passwd etc
In RFI, we can fetch rsrcs from some other servers

Eg: In LFI, /etc/passwd file of victim
In RFI, a local .php or .txt file from the attacker's system can be fetched by manipulating the URL in the similar way of LFI

- In some cases http will be filtered so try to use mixed cases like hTTp like that and check for RFI
